# BDCMail

Back in 2001, James Madison University email consisted of a simple IMAP mail system. Good luck checking your email if you had to use a friend's computer. Heck, you couldn't even check your email on any of the public computers strewn about campus. BDCMail solved the problem by being a webmail system before most webmail systems existed.

I can't believe I used to write code like this.
